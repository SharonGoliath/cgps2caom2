HISTORY   made very reasonable efforts to produce accurate data, but no warranty

HISTORY   "The Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS) is a Canadian project with

HISTORY   The original data are from "The FCRAO CO Survey of the Outer Galaxy"  
HISTORY   (Heyer, M.H., Brunt, C., Snell, R.L., Howe, J.E., Schloerb, F.P., &   
HISTORY   Carpenter, J.M., 1998, Ap.J. Supp., 115, 241). The data have been     
HISTORY   regridded from the FCRAO 50.22" pixel scale to the CGPS 18" pixel     
HISTORY   scale using DRAO program "mapconvrt" and from the FCRAO 0.812565 km/s 
HISTORY   velocity sampling to the CGPS 0.82446 km/s velocity sampling using    
HISTORY   DRAO program "cubinterp", both employing cubic interpolation. The     
HISTORY   data were also smoothed to the Nyquist resolution limit of 1.674'     
HISTORY   (2 FCRAO pixels) prior to spatial regridding. The user should thus be 
HISTORY   aware that the angular resolution is not that of the 45" FCRAO beam,  
HISTORY   but has been limited by the sampling of the FCRAO Outer Galaxy Survey 
HISTORY   to 100.44". The data have been scaled from the observed antenna       
HISTORY   temperature scale, referred to above the Earth's atmosphere (T_A*),   
HISTORY   to the radiation temperature scale (T_R*) by correcting for forward   
HISTORY   scattering and spillover losses (eta_fss = 0.7).

HISTORY   Prior to smoothing and regridding, the FCRAO Outer Galaxy Survey data 
HISTORY   have been re-processed at DRAO, a project jointly supported by DRAO,  
HISTORY   the University of Calgary and FCRAO. A document describing the        
HISTORY   re-processing methods and the differences between the original and    
HISTORY   re-processed data is in preparation at the time of the current release
